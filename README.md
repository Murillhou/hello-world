hello-world
===========

First repository i create. I really dont know exactly what to write here at the moment. 

Well, now i know that you can write a "commit changes message" where you should be making comments about the changes youÂ´ve done in the file.
I also have learned about the projects branches and, in fact, im writing this in a separate branch called "readme-edits".

The true is i didn wrote that in a different branch!! i hope, this time it works...

Well, it worked, and now im making changes to the file in a different branch i can compare and merge with the master branch if needed.
